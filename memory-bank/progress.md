## What's Left to Build
- [ ] Multi-user authentication (V2)
- [ ] Bi-directional sync (V2)
- [ ] Advanced reporting and analytics
- [ ] Mobile app (post-V2)
- [ ] Kubernetes deployment (post-V2)
- [ ] Additional connectors (Jira, Freshdesk, etc.)
- [ ] Optional: Frontend UI enhancement for IP display in Audit section

## Known Issues
- [ ] Pre-existing test failures in `test_kimai_metadata.py` (mock setup issues with AsyncMock)
  - Tests: get_customer_name_caches, get_customer_name_ttl_expires, get_customer_name_error_returns_none
  - get_project_name_caches, get_activity_name_caches
  - Root cause: AsyncMock not awaited properly in service methods
  - Impact: Non-blocking (core functionality works); fix requires updating test mocks to use `await mock_get.return_value.json()`
- [ ] npm vulnerabilities in frontend (4 moderate) - run `npm audit fix`

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Single-Page UI**: Initially multi-page, refactored to anchored single-page for better UX and discoverability
- **Sync Direction**: Started one-way (Zammad → Kimai); bi-directional planned for V2
- **Authentication**: Simple JWT admin user (V1); multi-user RBAC planned for V2
- **Scheduling**: In-process APScheduler (V1); Celery + Redis planned for distributed scaling (V2)
- **Error Handling**: Progressive enhancement from basic try-catch to intelligent classification with user-friendly messages
- **Testing**: Backend unit tests established; frontend E2E with Playwright planned for V2
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose (V1); Kubernetes Helm chart planned for V2
- **Audit Logging**: Initially basic; enhanced with IP tracking for security/compliance (November 2025)
- **Audit Fixes**: Addressed dev-specific issues (auth races, CORS) for stable multi-setup access
- **Scheduling Enhancement**: Added dynamic rescheduling, concurrency modes, and UI presets (November 2025)

## Recent Changes Summary (November 2025)
- **Implemented Scheduling Feature for Automatic Sync Runs**:
  - **Goal**: Add comprehensive scheduling for periodic syncs with UI configuration, dynamic rescheduling, concurrency control, and notifications.
  - **Backend Implementation**:
    - Created database migration (`backend/alembic/versions/20251111_1742_138c27fb806b_add_schedules_table.py`) for `schedules` table (single row: id, cron, timezone, concurrency, notifications, enabled, timestamps).
    - Created `Schedule` model (`backend/app/models/schedule.py`) with SQLAlchemy fields and relationships.
    - Created schedule schemas (`backend/app/schemas/schedule.py`) with Pydantic validation: `ScheduleBase` (cron validation via croniter, timezone via ZoneInfo), `ScheduleResponse` (with computed `next_runs`), `ScheduleUpdate` (optional fields).
    - Created schedule endpoints (`backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/schedule.py`):
      - `GET /api/v1/schedule`: Fetches or creates default schedule; computes next 3 runs using croniter (respects timezone).
      - `PUT /api/v1/schedule`: Updates schedule, tracks changes for audit, calls `reschedule_sync_job()` for dynamic updates without restart.
    - Created scheduler service (`backend/app/scheduler.py`): APScheduler integration with AsyncIOScheduler; `scheduled_sync_job()` executes sync with concurrency handling (skip/queue, queue limit 5); `reschedule_sync_job()` for dynamic cron changes; `start_scheduler()` loads from DB on startup; `shutdown_scheduler()` for graceful shutdown.
    - Integrated scheduler in `backend/app/main.py`: `@app.on_event("startup")` calls `start_scheduler()`; `@app.on_event("shutdown")` calls `shutdown_scheduler()`.
    - Added `croniter>=2.0.0` to `backend/requirements.txt` for cron parsing/validation.
    - Audit integration: `schedule_updated` event with changes dict (old/new values).
    - Notification framework: Logs when conflicts >10 or failures occur (extendable to email/webhook).
  - **Frontend Implementation**:
    - Added `Schedule` and `ScheduleUpdate` types to `frontend/src/types/index.ts`.
    - Added `scheduleService` to `frontend/src/services/api.service.ts`: `get()` and `update()` methods.
    - Created `ScheduleDialog` component (`frontend/src/components/ScheduleDialog.tsx`):
      - Presets: Hourly, Every 6h, Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Custom (auto-generates cron).
      - Time picker for daily/weekly/monthly; weekday chips for weekly (Mon-Sun, at least one required).
      - Timezone selector (UTC, Europe/Brussels, etc.).
      - Concurrency policy (skip/queue with descriptions).
      - Notifications toggle (alerts on failures/high conflicts).
      - Enable/disable toggle.
      - Client validation: Non-empty cron, required time/days for presets, toast errors.
      - Next 3 runs preview: Localized timestamps using Intl.DateTimeFormat with selected timezone.
      - TanStack Query integration: Fetches on open, invalidates on save.
    - Wired into `frontend/src/pages/SyncDashboard.tsx`: Replaced top bar placeholder with `<ScheduleDialog />`; imported component.
  - **Key Features**:
    - Dynamic rescheduling without restart (API-driven).
    - Concurrency enforcement: Skip prevents overlaps; queue limits to 5.
    - Preset editing updates cron; manual cron overrides presets.
    - Weekly DOW chips generate correct cron (e.g., "0 9 * * 1,3,5" for Mon/Wed/Fri).
    - Next runs computed server-side, displayed client-side with timezone formatting.
    - Audit logs all changes (`schedule_updated` with diff).
    - Toasts for success/error; disable save during pending.
  - **Impact**:
    - Full scheduling capability: Automatic periodic syncs with UI control.
    - No service restart needed for changes; immediate effect.
    - Compliance: All updates audited; notifications for issues.
    - UX: Intuitive presets with validation; real-time preview.
  - **Testing**: Migration applied; dependencies installed; backend scheduler starts; frontend dialog fetches/saves; cron validation works; next runs localize correctly.
  - **Files Modified**: Multiple (migrations, models, schemas, endpoints, scheduler, main.py, requirements.txt, frontend types/service/components/dashboard).
  - **Compliance**: Backward compatible; extends existing APScheduler; production ready.

- **Fixed Audit Section Issues**:
  - **Goal**: Resolve 401 Unauthorized, 307 Redirects, login loops, and 405 Method Not Allowed errors after adding audit section.
  - **Root Causes**:
    - Trailing slash mismatch between frontend API call (/audit-logs) and backend route (/audit-logs/), causing 307 redirects.
    - Race condition: Audit logs useQuery triggered before authentication token set in localStorage, leading to 401 and login loop via response interceptor.
    - CORS preflight failures (405 in console) due to limited origins in config.py, varying across computers (ports, localhost vs 127.0.0.1).
  - **Frontend Fixes**:
    - Updated `frontend/src/services/api.service.ts`: Changed audit GET to '/audit-logs/' to match backend exactly, eliminating redirects.
    - Updated `frontend/src/pages/SyncDashboard.tsx`: Added `enabled: isAuthenticated` (from AuthContext) to auditLogs useQuery to prevent pre-auth fetches.
    - Updated `frontend/src/lib/api.ts`: Modified response interceptor to only redirect on 401 if Authorization header was present (invalid token), preventing loops on unauthenticated requests.
  - **Backend Fixes**:
    - Updated `backend/app/config.py`: Expanded `cors_origins` to include common dev setups (localhost:3000/5173/8080, 127.0.0.1 equivalents) for broader compatibility.
  - **Impact**:
    - No more 307 redirects; direct 200 responses for audit fetches.
    - No premature 401s or login loops; queries wait for auth confirmation.
    - CORS preflights succeed across browsers/computers; no 405 console errors.
    - Backward compatible; other endpoints unaffected.
  - **Testing**: Verified login → dashboard load without errors; audit section displays data; stable on multiple setups.
  - **Files Modified**: api.service.ts, SyncDashboard.tsx, api.ts, config.py.
  - **Compliance**: Enhances dev experience; no security changes.

- **Implemented IP Tracking for Audit Logs**:
  - **Goal**: Track IP addresses and user agents for all critical operations to enhance security and compliance.
  - **Backend Implementation**:
    - Created database migration adding `ip_address` and `user_agent` columns to `audit_logs` table with composite index.
    - Updated `AuditLog` model and audit schemas to include IP fields.
    - Created IP extraction utility supporting Traefik proxy headers (X-Forwarded-For first IP, X-Real-IP fallback).
    - Created audit logging helper for automatic IP/user agent capture.
    - Integrated audit logging into all endpoints: authentication (`login_success`, `login_failed`), connectors (`connector_created`, `connector_updated`, `connector_deleted`), mappings (`mapping_created`, `mapping_updated`, `mapping_deleted`), sync (`sync_triggered`), reconcile (`conflict_resolved`).
    - Enhanced audit logs endpoint with filters: `action_type` (access/sync/all), `ip_address`, `user`, date range.
    - Created cleanup service for 90-day retention (access logs only; sync logs permanent).
  - **Frontend Implementation**:
    - Updated types: Added `ip_address?: string` and `user_agent?: string` to `AuditLog` interface.
    - Updated API service: Enhanced `getAuditLogs()` to support new filters (`action_type`, `ip_address`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `user`).
    - Fixed TypeScript errors in SyncDashboard (removed `runId` parameter from audit query).
  - **Impact**:
    - Complete audit trail with IP tracking for security/compliance.
    - Proxy-aware IP detection (Traefik/Nginx compatible).
    - Efficient querying/filtering by IP and action type.
    - Automatic retention policy ready for scheduler.
  - **Testing**: Database migration applied; backend endpoints log IPs; frontend API calls support filters; TypeScript build clean.
  - **Files Modified**: Multiple (migrations, models, schemas, utils, endpoints, services, frontend types/service/dashboard).
  - **Compliance**: Maintains existing API contracts; backward compatible; production ready.

- **Fixed Reconcile Screen Data Extraction (November 2025)**:
  - **Problem**: Reconcile screen showed "Unknown" for activity types and users despite rich data in database
  - **Root Cause**: Sync service created conflicts without populating `zammad_data` and `kimai_data` JSONB fields; extraction logic was correct but no data to extract
  - **Backend Fixes** (`backend/app/services/sync_service.py`):
    - Added `zammad_data=z_entry.model_dump()` to all conflict creation points (unmapped activity, creation errors, time mismatches/duplicates)
    - Added `kimai_data=k_entry.model_dump()` for conflict cases with existing Kimai entries
    - Now stores complete normalized entry data (user names, activity types, descriptions, timestamps) in JSONB fields
  - **Impact**: 
    - Reconcile endpoint now extracts real user names from `zammad_data.user_name`/`user_email`
    - Activity types from `activity_name` or `zammad_data.activity_type_name`
    - Descriptions and full metadata available for display
    - Existing conflicts unaffected (still show "Unknown"); new conflicts after sync will show complete data
  - **Frontend**: No changes needed - extraction logic in `_conflict_to_diffitem()` already handled JSONB data correctly
  - **Testing**: Run new sync to create conflicts; verify Reconcile screen shows actual user names, activity types, and descriptions
  - **Compliance**: Backward compatible; no schema changes; existing conflicts remain functional
